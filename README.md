# First Python Repo

This is a repo where I´m commiting .py-files about my beginnings with Python!

I´m commiting here until I have some knowledge about Python and know how it works.

Later I´ll creating repositories about some little projects I´ve created with Python.

If you want, you can use this files for your own learning or other purposes.
